# Fragments

Fragments can also be attributed to the way snippets are organized. You can create tabs inside a snippet, for example, to create different versions of snippets or when a snippet consists of different languages.

## Adding a Fragment

- Select **"File"** > **"New Fragment"** from the menu bar
- Click **"+"** button on the top right corner of the editor.
- Press <kbd>Cmd+T</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Ctrl+T</kbd> on Windows or Linux.

## Renaming and Deleting

Call the context menu by right-clicking on the fragment and selecting **"Rename"** or **"Delete"**.

::: warning
The deleted fragment cannot be recovered.
